# Host-Benchmark-Results

This is where results for the [main repository](https://github.com/amnoah/Host-Benchmark) are tracked neatly and nicely.

# BE AWARE

Results may be submitted/gained through the hosting provider rather than a customer. Be cautious with these results as they have potential to be altered in a misleading manner. All results in the spread sheets are marked whether they're customer provided or host provided.

# How to Submit a Score

- [Read the pinned discussion describing the formatting of any posts you submit](https://github.com/amnoah/Host-Benchmark-Results/discussions/1)
- [Make a post following that formatting in the Submit Scores section of the Discussions forum](https://github.com/amnoah/Host-Benchmark-Results/discussions/categories/submit-scores)
- Either wait for a repository maintainer to add the information to the lists or create a PR where you update all applicable result lists with the information.

# Where Are Scores?

- For individual postings you can look through [the submit scores section of the Discussions forum](https://github.com/amnoah/Host-Benchmark-Results/discussions/categories/submit-scores).
- You can view the scores put inside of a list [here](https://github.com/amnoah/Host-Benchmark-Results/tree/main/0.3), you just have to choose which software type to look through.
